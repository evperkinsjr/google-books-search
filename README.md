# Google Books Search
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
This full-stack application lets users search the Google Books API for books of interest. When users enter a book title, author, or keyword into the search field, they're presented with a list of results. Each result displays the book cover, title, author(s), description, and preview link. There's a save button next to each result so users can save the book to the "Saved" page. On the "Saved" page, users can see saved books and remove them from the list using delete button.

The application was deployed using Heroku.
